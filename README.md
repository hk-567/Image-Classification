# Image-Classification
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. This code trains a CNN model and evaluates its accuracy. It also loads an image, resizes it to the appropriate dimensions, and makes predictions on the image's content.
